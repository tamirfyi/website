I wrote my first computer program when I was 17 years old. It was in Java, and all it did was print out "Hello world" to an iMac in my high school computer lab. I didn't understand how my computer could interpret the code I wrote and print what I told it to, but I thought it was really cool that it could.

One thing I did know was that someone had to build whatever it took for my computer to print those words on my screen. That interested me! I remember thinking in that moment: what do you have to learn in order to be a good programmer? What else could I program once I learned all of that? Since then, I knew I wanted to become a software engineer.

Fast forward a bit -- 6 years to be specific -- and I have a Bachelor's degree in computer engineering, a Master's degree in computer science (both from UC Santa Cruz), and I have been working as a software engineer for almost 7 months.

One thing I really liked doing as a student was taking notes; it helped me better understand the things I was learning at the time. I would use an iPad with an Apple Pencil to take handwritten notes or highlight academic papers and slides I needed for class. I noticed that when I transitioned from a student to a full-time software engineer I stopped taking notes entirely, but I want to change that. So, I created this blog with the hopes of writing about things I learn, projects I work on, and anything else I might find interesting as a software engineer and avid user of technology.

That first computer program took me wonderful places... let's see where this takes me.
